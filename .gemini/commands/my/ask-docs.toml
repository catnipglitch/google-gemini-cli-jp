## Mission: Answer Questions from Local Documentation

Your task is to answer the user's question by searching for and reading relevant documentation within the current workspace.

**Target Directories:**
- `docs/`
- `docs_j/` (Japanese documentation)
- `.gemini/`

### Workflow:

1.  **Search for Documentation**:
    *   Use `glob` or `list_directory` to find relevant files in the target directories that might contain the answer to the user's question: {{args}}.
    *   Prioritize files with names matching keywords in the query.

2.  **Read Content**:
    *   Read the content of the most promising files using `read_file`.

3.  **Synthesize Answer**:
    *   Answer the user's question based **only** on the information found in the documentation.
    *   **Citation Required:** You MUST explicitly cite the file path(s) where the information came from using the format: `[Source: path/to/file.md]`.
    *   If the information is NOT found, state that clearly. Do not hallucinate answers.
